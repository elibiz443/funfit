    <p class="text-neutral-200 max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
      We believe movement is more than exercise — it’s connection, discipline, and growth.  
      At Functional Fitness, every workout is designed to bring people together, build consistency, and create results that last.  
      No competition. No intimidation. Just community, energy, and progress.

          We move as one — encouraging and supporting each other through every rep, set, and milestone.
