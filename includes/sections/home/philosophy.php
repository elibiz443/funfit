    <p class="text-neutral-200 max-w-3xl mx-auto leading-relaxed">
      We believe movement is more than exercise — it’s connection, discipline, and growth.  
      At Functional Fitness, every workout is designed to bring people together, build consistency, and create results that last.  
      No competition. No intimidation. Just community, energy, and progress.
